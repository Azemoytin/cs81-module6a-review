### What was the hardest part to understand?
the hardest part to understand was how `this` works in each method. It was confusing at first, but in this code, `this` always points to the playlist object being used.

### How does this code use `this` to tie data and behavior together?
This code uses `this` to tie data and behavior together by connecting the playlistâ€™s data with the actions it can do. Each method uses `this` to make sure it's working with the correct playlist.

### What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
What i would do differently if I wrote this object from scratch would be to add an `Array` which would include the following: song title, author, and duration. This would be for my own personal song playlist.
